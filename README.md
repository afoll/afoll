- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew.  (If you are looking for Robert, that is also me.  I am one of those Southerners that got saddled with their middle name being their primary name.)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in 'metrics, AI, and DL.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning recommendation systems.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at robert dot andrew dot follett 'at' gmail dot com, but you should and probably do care more about finding more pics of my black lab Barry on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/good.boy.barry/).
